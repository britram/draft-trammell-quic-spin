       The Addition of a Spin Bit to the QUIC Transport Protocol
                    draft-trammell-quic-spin-latest

Abstract

   This document summarizes work to date on the addition of a "spin
   bit", intended for explicit measurability of end-to-end RTT on QUIC
   flows.  It proposes a detailed mechanism for the spin bit, describes
   how to use it to measure end-to-end latency, discusses corner cases
   and workarounds therefor in the measurement, describes experimental
   evaluation of the mechanism done to date, and examines the utility
   and privacy implications of the spin bit.  As the overhead and risk
   associated with the spin bit are negligible, and the utility of a
   passive RTT measurement signal at higher resolution than once per
   flow is clear, this document advocates for the addition of the spin
   bit to the protocol.

1.  Introduction

   [EDITOR'S NOTE: Brian to write frontmatter.  Why we care, why this
   draft exists.]

2.  The Spin Bit Mechanism

   The latency spin bit enables latency monitoring from observation
   points on the network path.  The bit is set by the endpoints in the
   following way:




Trammell, et al.          Expires June 1, 2018                  [Page 2]

   o  The server sets the spin bit value to the value of the spin bit in
      the packet received from the client with the largest packet
      number.

   o  The client sets the spin bit value to the opposite of the value
      set in the packet received from the server with the largest packet
      number, or to 0 if no packet as been received yet.

   If packets are delivered in order, this procedure will cause the spin
   bit to change value in each direction once per round trip.
   Observation points can estimate the network latency by observing
   these changes in the latency spin bit, as described in Section 3.

2.1.  Proposed Short Header Format Including Spin Bit

   Since it is possible to measure handshake RTT without a spin bit (see
   Section 3.2), it is sufficient to include the spin bit in the short
   packet header.  This proposal suggests to ues the second most
   significant bit (0x40) of the first octet in the short header for the
   spin bit.

   This will shift the Connection ID flag and the Key Phase Bit to 0x20
   and 0x10 respectively, and will limit the number of available short
   packet types to 16.

3.  Using the Spin Bit for Passive RTT Measurement

   When a QUIC flow is sending at full rate (i.e., neither application
   nor flow control limited), the latency spin bit in each direction
   changes value once per round-trip time (RTT).  An on-path observer
   can observe the time difference between edges in the spin bit signal
   to measure one sample of end-to-end RTT.  Note that this measurement,

Internet-Draft                  Spin Bit                   November 2017


   as with passive RTT measurement for TCP, includes any transport
   protocol delay (e.g., delayed sending of acknowledgements) and/or
   application layer delay (e.g., waiting for a request to complete).
   It therefore provides devices on path a good instantaneous estimate
   of the RTT as experienced by the application.  A simple linear
   smoothing or moving minimum filter can be applied to the stream of
   RTT information to get a more stable estimate.

   We note that the Latency Spin Bit, and the measurements that can be
   done with it, can be seen as an end-to-end extension of a special
   case of the alternate marking method described in [ALT-MARK].

3.1.  Limitations and Workarounds

   Application-limited and flow-control-limited senders can have
   application and transport layer delay, respectively, that are much
   greater than network RTT.  Therefore, the spin bit provides network
   latency information only when the sender is neither application nor
   flow control limited.  When the sender is application-limited by
   periodic application traffic, where that period is longer than the
   RTT, measuring the spin bit provides information about the
   application period, not the RTT.  Simple heuristics based on the
   observed data rate per flow or changes in the RTT series can be used
   to reject bad RTT samples due to application or flow control
   limitation.

   Since the spin bit logic at each endpoint considers only samples on
   packets that advance the largest packet number seen, signal
   generation itself is resistent to reordering.  However, reordering
   can cause problems at an observer by causing spurious edge detection
   and therefore low RTT estimates.  This can be probabilistically
   mitigated by the observer tracking the low-order bits of the packet
   number, and rejecting edges that appear out-of-order.

3.2.  Alternate RTT Measurement Approaches for Diagnosing QUIC flows

   There are two broad alternatives to explicit signaling for passive
   RTT measurement for measuring the RTT experienced by QUIC flows.

   The first of these is handshake RTT measurement.  As described in
   [QUIC-MGT], the packets of the QUIC handshake are distinguishable on
   the wire in such a way that they can be used for one RTT measurement
   sample per flow: the delay between the client initial and the server
   cleartext packet can be used to measure "upstream" RTT (between the
   observer and the server), and the delay between the server cleartext
   packet and the next client cleartext packet can be used to measure
   "downstream" RTT (between the client and the observer).  When RTT
   measurements are used in large aggregates (all flows traversing a



Trammell, et al.          Expires June 1, 2018                  [Page 4]

   large link, for example), a methodology based on handshake RTT could
   be used to generate sufficient samples for some use cases (e.g.
   [EDITOR'S NOTE: cite use cases here]) without the spin bit.  However,
   this methodology would rely on the assumption that the difference
   between handshake RTT and nominal in-flow RTT is negligible.
   Specifically, (1) any additional delay required to compute any
   cryptographic parameters must be negligible with respect to network
   RTT; (2) any additional delay required to establish state along the
   path must be negligible with respect to network RTT; and (3) network
   treatment of initial packets in a flow must identical to that of
   later packets in the flow.  When these assumptions cannot be shown to
   hold, spin-bit based RTT measurement is preferable to handshake RTT
   measurement, even for applications for which handshake RTT
   measurement would otherwise be suitable.

   The second alternative is parallel active measurement: using ICMP
   Echo Request and Reply [RFC0792] [RFC4433], a dedicated measurement
   protocol like TWAMP [RFC5357], or a separate diagnostic QUIC flow to
   measure RTT.  Regardless of protocol, the active measurement must be
   initiated by a client on the same network as the client of the QUIC
   flow(s) of interest, or a network close by in the Internet topology,
   toward the server.  Note that there is no guarantee that ICMP flows
   will receive the same network treatment as the flows under study,
   both due to differential treatment of ICMP traffic and due to ECMP
   routing (see e.g.  [TOKYO-PING]).  TWAMP and QUIC diagnostic flows,
   though both use UDP, have similar issues regarding ECMP.  However, in
   situations where the entity doing the measurement can guarantee that
   the active measurement traffic will traverse the subpaths of interest
   (e.g.  residential access network measurement under a network
   architecture and business model where the network operator owns the
   CPE), active measurement can be used to generate RTT samples at the
   cost of at least two non-productive packets sent though the network
   per sample.

4.  Use Cases for Passive RTT Measurement

   This section describes current use cases for passive RTT measurement
   with TCP, i.e., the matching of packets based on sequence and
   acknowledgment numbers, or timestamps and timestamp echoes, in order
   to generate upstream and downstream RTT samples which can be added to
   get end-to-end RTT, as with handshake RTT in Section 3.2.  These
   current use cases would be consumers of RTT samples measured from the
   spin bit as in Section 3.

   In all cases, the basic measurement methodology follows one of a few
   basic variants.  The RTT evolution of a flow or a set of flows can be
   compared to baseline or expected RTT measurements for flows with the
   same characterisitcs... [EDITOR'S NOTE: other variants go here]

4.1.  Video Delivery Troubleshooting

   [EDITOR'S NOTE: merge with Emile's interdomain troubleshooting
   section?]

   [EDITOR'S NOTE: this is rewritten from Roni's text on video; Roni,
   please check.]

   Network access providers are often the first point of contact by
   their customers when network problems impact the performance of
   bandwidth-intensive and latency-sensitive applications such as video,
   regardless of whether the root cause lies within the access
   provider's network, the service provider's network, on the Internet
   paths between them, or within the customer's own network.

   Many residential networks use WiFi (802.11) on the last segment, and
   WiFi signal strength degradation manifests in high first-hop delay,
   due to the fact that the MAC layer will retransmit loss packets in
   order to trade latency off for loss.  Measuring the RTT between
   endpoints on the customer network and parts of the service provider's
   own infrastructure (which have predictable delay characteristics) can
   be used to isolate this cause of performance problems.

   Comparing the evolution of passively-measured RTTs between a customer
   network and selected other networks on the Internet to short- and
   medium-term baseline measurements can be used to isolate high latency
   to specific networks or network segments.  For example, if the RTTs
   of all flows to a given service provider increase at the same time,
   the problem likely exists between the access network and the service
   provider, or in the service provider's network itself.  On the other
   hand, if the RTTs of all flows for a set of customers sharing some
   give access provider infrastructure increase, then the problem is
   likely attributable to that infrastructure.

   In both of these cases, handshake RTT as in Section 3.2 would provide
   limited information, presuming that its assumptions hold.  Intraflow
   measurements are necessary in this case to increase the baseline and
   measurement data available, and to increase the chance that enough
   samples are available for arbitrarily small aggregates.

5.  Privacy and Security Considerations

   The privacy considerations for the latency spin bit are essentially
   the same as those for passive RTT measurement in general.

   A concern was raised during the discussion of this feature within the
   QUIC working group and the QUIC RTT Design Team that high-resolution
   RTT information might be usable for geolocation.  However, an
   evaluation based on RTT samples taken over 13,780 paths in the
   Internet from RIPE Atlas anchoring measurements [TRILAT] shows that
   the magnitude and uncertainty of RTT data render the resolution of
   geolocation information that can be derived from Internet RTT is
   limited to national- or continental-scale; i.e., less resolution than
   is generally available from free, open IP geolocation databases.
   Therefore, in the general case, when an endpoint's IP address is
   known, RTT information provides negligible additional information.

   RTT information may be used to infer the occupancy of queues along a
   path; indeed, this is part of its utility for performance measurement
   and diagnostics.  When a link on given path has excessive buffering
   (on the order of hundreds of milliseconds or more; a situation
   colloquially referred to as "bufferbloat"), such that the difference
   in delay between an empty queue and a full queue dwarfs normal
   variance and RTT along the path, RTT variance during the lifetime of
   a flow can be used to infer the presence of traffic on the bottleneck
   link.  In practice, however, this is not a concern for passive
   measurement of congestion-controlled traffic, since any observer in a
   situation to observe RTT passively need not infer the presence of the
   traffic, as it can observe it directly.

   In addition, since RTT information contains application as well as
   network delay, patterns in RTT variance from minimum, and therefore
   application delay, can be used to infer or fingerprint application-
   layer behavior.  However, as with the case above, this is not a
   concern with passive measurement, since the packet size and
   interarrival time sequence, which is also directly observable,
   carries more information than RTT variance sequence.

   We therefore conclude that the high-resolution, per-flow exposure of
   RTT for passive measurement as provided by the spin bit poses
   negligible marginal risk to privacy.

   As shown in Section 2, the spin bit can be implemented separately
   from the rest of the mechanisms of the QUIC transport protocol, as it
   requires no access to any state other than that observable in the
   QUIC packet header itself.  We recommend that implementations take
   advantage of this property, to reduce the risk that a errors in the

   implementation could leak private transport protocol state through
   the spin bit.
